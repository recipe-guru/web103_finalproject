## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Completing the backend APIs and setting up the frontend boilerplate went smoothly. The integration between the backend and the initial frontend components, such as the login and registration pages, was successful, and We managed to implement user authentication effectively. The overall progress aligned well with the sprint plan.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges was ensuring seamless communication between the backend APIs and the frontend, particularly managing authentication and session persistence. Additionally, configuring the development environment to work efficiently across different setups required some troubleshooting. Handling edge cases in user authentication and error handling was also more complex than expected.

### 3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Most of the tasks in the sprint plan were completed, including backend API development and frontend setup. However, a few minor features related to user experience and error handling remain. We would prioritize these tasks in the next sprint, focusing first on refining error handling and improving the user interface to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 4. Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The features at risk include implementing advanced user preferences and recipe filtering, as they require more complex data management and integration with external APIs. If these items remain at risk, We will allocate additional time for testing and debugging in the next sprint and consider simplifying some features if necessary to maintain the overall project timeline.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Moving forward, I may need additional support in optimizing API calls and ensuring efficient data handling for performance. Guidance on best practices for error handling and improving user experience on the frontend would also be beneficial. Additionally, a review of the project architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability would be helpful.
